It is by no means recommended to use every single question here on the same candidate (that would take hours). Choosing a few items from this list should help you vet the intended skills you require.\r\n\r\n[Rebecca Murphey](http://rmurphey.com/)'s [Baseline For Front-End Developers](http://rmurphey.com/blog/2012/04/12/a-baseline-for-front-end-developers/) is also a great resource to read up on before you head into an interview. \r\n\r\n**Note:** Keep in mind that many of these questions are open ended and could lead to interesting discussions that tell you more about the person's capabilities than a straight answer would.\r\n\r\n####Original Contributors\r\n\r\nThe majority of the questions were plucked from an [oksoclap](http://oksoclap.com/) thread created originally by [Paul Irish](http://paulirish.com) ([@paul_irish](http://twitter.com/paul_irish)) and contributed to by the following individuals:\r\n\r\n* [@bentruyman](http://twitter.com/bentruyman) - http://bentruyman.com\r\n* [@cowboy](http://twitter.com/cowboy) - http://benalman.com\r\n* [@ajpiano](http://ajpiano) - http://ajpiano.com\r\n* [@SlexAxton](http://twitter.com/slexaxton) - http://alexsexton.com\r\n* [@boazsender](http://twitter.com/boazsender) - http://boazsender.com\r\n* [@miketaylr](http://twitter.com/miketaylr) - http://miketaylr.com\r\n* [@vladikoff](http://twitter.com/vladikoff) - http://vladfilippov.com\r\n* [@gf3](http://twitter.com/gf3) - http://gf3.ca\r\n* [@jon_neal](http://twitter.com/jon_neal) - http://twitter.com/jon_neal\r\n* [@wookiehangover](http://twitter.com/wookiehangover) - http://wookiehangover.com\r\n* [@darcy_clarke](http://twitter.com/darcy) - http://darcyclarke.me\r\n* [@iansym](http://twitter.com)\r\n\r\n### General Questions:\r\n\r\n* What version control systems have you used (Git, SVN etc.)? \r\n* What is your preferred development environment?
